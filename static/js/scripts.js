// JavaScript code to handle habit selection and view switching is already included in the tasks.html template
// If you have more JavaScript code, you can include it here

// Example: Implementing view switching logic (this is a placeholder)
function showView(viewType) {
    // Implement the logic to filter and display tasks based on the selected view type
    // For example, you could use AJAX to fetch tasks for the selected date range
    console.log('View type ' + viewType + ' selected.');
}
